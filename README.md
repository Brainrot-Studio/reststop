# RESTStop

RESTStop is a lightweight desktop tool for testing and debugging REST APIs. Built with Electron. No fluff, just the essentials.

---

## Features

- Send GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH requests
- Set custom headers and request bodies
- View raw response, headers, and formatted JSON
- HTML preview support
- Local request history (stored in `localStorage`)
- Minimal UI with dark mode by default

---

## Why

Most API tools are bloated or overly complicated. RESTStop is meant to be simple, fast, and focused â€” something you can just open and use.
