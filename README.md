# RESTStop

A no-BS REST client for developers who just want to send HTTP requests... Without logging in, syncing to the cloud, or navigating five menus to do it.

---

## Why RESTStop?

Most API tools are bloated, slow, or built around team workflows you didn’t ask for.

RESTStop is local. Fast. Focused. No sign-in. No telemetry. No friction.

You open it, make a request, and get a response. That’s it.

---

## Features

- Supports all standard HTTP request types
- Edit headers and raw request body
- Preview JSON or HTM in the response
- View full response headers and status
- Local request history (no accounts, no sync)
- Minimal UI with dark mode
- Built with Electron, so it runs anywhere

---

## Install
